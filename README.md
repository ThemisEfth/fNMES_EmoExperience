ðŸ“Š Exploring the Facial Feedback Hypothesis using Facial Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (fNMES)

Overview

This repository contains the data preparation and analysis code for the study:

Efthimiou, T. N., Baker, J., Elsenaar, A., Mehu, M., & Korb, S. (2025).
Smiling and frowning induced by facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) modulate felt emotion and physiology.
Emotion, 25(1), 79â€“92.

The study explores the Facial Feedback Hypothesis using Facial Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (fNMES) to investigate how artificially induced facial expressions (smiling and frowning) affect emotional experience and physiological responses.

ðŸ“ˆ Analyses Summary

The analysis workflow includes:
	â€¢	Data import and preparation
	â€¢	Loading libraries (tidyverse, lme4, ggstatsplot, etc.)
	â€¢	Importing participant data and recoding factors
	â€¢	Descriptive Statistics
	â€¢	Demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, BMI)
	â€¢	NMES intensity and discomfort ratings
	â€¢	Histograms of positive affect, negative affect, alexithymia (TAS), and baseline mood
	â€¢	Visualisations
	â€¢	Interactive plots (via ggplot2 + plotly) for:
	â€¢	Valence and arousal by stimulation condition and image presence
	â€¢	Discomfort ratings by condition
	â€¢	Statistical Modelling
	â€¢	Linear mixed-effects models for:
	â€¢	Valence and arousal with/without image presentation
	â€¢	Model comparison to identify best fit
	â€¢	Linear regressions exploring:
	â€¢	Discomfort as a function of muscle, intensity, and mood
	â€¢	Valence by muscle group
